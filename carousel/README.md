# Carousel - [*** Live site ***](http://ec2-35-178-239-59.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/)



Hey guys. Thanks for taking the time to look over my application.

This has been one of the more interesting tests I've taken. I didn't manage to get the task completely done, but I'm happy with what I managed to do, given the time frame.

### Given a little more time I'd like to have added the following:
  * Finish off the carousel with the animating screens
  * Integration tests for the carousel component. (I like TestCafe. Please refer to my [*portfolio*](https://github.com/mikeyrt1612) for examples)
  * It would have been really nice to add Typescript

Obviously if you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
